# internet-pi-in-k3s/k8s
Internet-Pi project in Kubernetes

Goal of this repo/project is to extend functionality of Jeff Geerling's internet-pi project to run on a k3s/k8s cluster, instead of a single node/instance.  This will allow the various containers (blackbox, prometheus, grafana, ping) to run on any node in the cluster, if the original node fails.
